# Exclude-Gif-Files-from-Conversion-in-Imagify-WP-Plugin
This custom plugin helps to automatically exclude .gif files from being converted to .WebP file formats in Imagify

## Here's how to use the plugin on WordPress:

1. Download this repository to your local machine and upload it to your WordPress plugin folder in cPanel. Unzip it and have the folder. Alternatively, you can upload the plugin directly to your WordPress plugin area from your WordPress Admin dashboard.
2. In your WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to Plugins > Installed Plugins and activate the new plugin named "Exclude Gifs from Imagify". This way, GIF images and/or files will be excluded from being converted to WebP format during the Imagify optimization process.


I hope this helps explain how you can use this plugin. For further help and support, please reach out to Imagify support through: https://imagify.io/support/.
